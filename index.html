      Hello! My name is Jhenyffer, born in Brazil and currently living in
      Canada. I have experience working as an administrative assistant and in
      telemarketing. After attending business school with a focus on
      professional communication, I made a bold decision to move to Canada
      before completing my studies. Now, I'm pursuing a new career path in
      software development, and I'm currently enrolled in college to gain the
      necessary skills for this exciting field. I'm looking forward to future
      job opportunities where I can make a meaningful impact through my work.
      I'm motivated by my love for problem-solving and creative thinking, which
      is why I'm determined to succeed in software development. I embrace the
      constant learning and growth that comes with it, envisioning a future
      where I can combine my strong communication skills with my newfound
      technical expertise. With my strong work ethic and adaptability, I know
      I'm well-equipped to navigate my college journey and prepare for an
      exciting career in the ever-evolving world of technology.
